# CapturePhotoOffset

Came across a weird visual glitch, so I asked a question on Stack overflow (["AVCapturePhotoOutput capturePhoto - result is offset/jumped down compared to preview"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67963803/avcapturephotooutput-capturephoto-result-is-offset-jumped-down-compared-to-pre)). Use this repo to reproduce the bug.
